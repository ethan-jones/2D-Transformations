## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

## Creating Files to Read Lines From

To have the program correctly read and input follow, you must follow the format of `datalines.txt`.

## Graph Information

The origin of the graph is at (0, 0). This means that any negative integers or integers beyond the dimensions of the window, will not be accepted.
The program handles and informs the user if their transformation ends up violating this.
